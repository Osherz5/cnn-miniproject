In this project we attempt to create a binary classifier that will take in small image patches that are a part of larger digital pathology scans, and will output 1 if metastatic cancer was found in that patch, or 0 otherwise.

A positive label indicates that the center 32x32px region of a patch contains at least one pixel of tumor tissue. Tumor tissue in the outer region of the patch does not influence the label.

The data provided is composed of 3 channel rgb images that are 96x96 pixels, and the training set size is around 220k images.
